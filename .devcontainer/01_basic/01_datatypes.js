1) Primitive Datatypes
       Number => number
       String  => string
       Boolean  => boolean
       null  => object
       undefined  =>  undefined
       Symbol  =>  symbol
       BigInt  =>  bigint

2) Non-primitive Datatypes
       Arrays  =>  object
       Function  =>  function
       Object  =>  object


       JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that variable types are determined at runtime, and you do not need to explicitly declare the type of a variable before using it. You can assign different types of values to a variable during its lifetime.
